Many organizations struggle with the skills and expertise needed to build, deploy, and maintain AI solutions. This gap often leads to delays, inefficiencies, and failed initiatives. But with the rise of Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) and Machine Learning Operations (MLOps), Platform Engineers are in a unique position to bridge this gap. By applying DevOps principles like automation, CI/CD, infrastructure-as-code, and cross-team collaboration, they can help development and data science teams deliver scalable AI solutions faster and more reliably.

In this series, I’ll explore how Platform Engineering teams can drive AI adoption and maximize the value of AI investments. We’ll follow the journey of ```GloboJava```, a fictional company implementing a demand forecasting ML solution on **[Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/)**. Through their experience, we’ll dive into real-world strategies, tools, and best practices to streamline AI development and deployment.

### Prerequisites
Before diving in, this guide assumes the following;
- You have a solid understanding of **[Core Machine Learning (ML) concepts](https://mitsloan.mit.edu/ideas-made-to-matter/machine-learning-explained)**, including model training, evaluation, and deployment. 
- You have a solid understanding of DevOps Concepts like CI/CD pipelines and Version Control
- You are comfortable working with tools like **[Azure ML SDK for Python)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/python/api/overview/azure/ml/?view=azure-ml-py)**, **[Azure Kubernetes (AKS)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/what-is-aks)**, **[Argo Workflows)](https://argoproj.github.io/workflows/)** and **[Terraform)](https://www.terraform.io/)**

### Why AI Projects Fail
Artificial Intelligence (AI) has the potential to drive innovation, improve decision-making, and unlock new business opportunities. However, many organizations struggle to move beyond the proof-of-concept stage due to challenges in developing, deploying, and maintaining AI solutions at scale.

Despite heavy investment in AI, many projects fail to deliver value due to:
- **Lack of operational expertise** – Data scientists and ML engineers often focus on building models but lack the skills to deploy and maintain them in production.
- **Siloed teams** – Development, data science, and operations teams often work independently, leading to misalignment and inefficiencies.
- **Infrastructure complexity** – AI workloads require specialized infrastructure, which can be difficult to set up, scale, and manage.
- **Inconsistent workflows** – Without standardized processes, model deployment and monitoring become ad-hoc and unreliable.

### Role of Platform Engineering in AI Adoption
Platform Engineers are uniquely positioned to solve these challenges by:

- Bridging the gap between software engineering, data science, and IT operations.
- Implementing DevOps principles to standardize and automate AI workflows.
- Building scalable AI platforms that enable reliable and repeatable ML model deployment.

### Introducing GloboJava
GloboJava is a coffee-focused company that sells beverages and pastries, aiming to deliver high-quality coffee with fast, reliable service. They operate in the U.S., Canada, and Mexico and plans to employ machine learning to predict demand for products at their various locations, optimizing inventory management and reducing food waste. They want to analyze their historical sales data, weather patterns, and local events and be able to forecast which items will be popular and adjust their inventory accordingly to improve operations, enhance customer experiences, and support better decision-making

- ### Understanding the problem
One key challenge GloboJava faces is predicting customer demand accurately. With fluctuating sales patterns due to seasons, holidays, and regional preferences, they often struggle with inventory management—leading to either overstocking or shortages. By leveraging their historical sales data, GloboJava can use machine learning to forecast demand more precisely. This will help them optimize inventory levels, reduce waste, and ensure popular products are always available when customers need them.

- ### Understanding the solution
To address the demand forecasting challenge, GloboJava can build a machine learning model using their five years of sales data stored in Snowflake. By analyzing historical sales trends, seasonal patterns, and regional preferences, the model can predict future demand for each product. This solution will enable GloboJava to optimize inventory levels, reduce waste, and ensure popular items are always in stock. The result? Improved customer satisfaction, lower costs, and smarter decision-making across their operations

- ### Understanding the Data
GloboJava collects sales data from their various stores located in America, Mexico and Canada, including:

- Store ID: A unique identifier for each Starbucks store.
- Date: The date of the sale.(Separate columns for Day, Month and Year)
- Country: The country where the store is located (USA, Mexico, Canada).
- City: The city where the store is located.
- Product Category: The category of the item (e.g., Coffee, Pastry, Beverage, Merchandise).
- Product: Specific product sold (e.g., "Caffe Latte", "Blueberry Muffin").
- Quantity Sold: The number of units of that product sold.
- Price: The price at which the product was sold.
- Total Sale: The total amount for that product (Quantity Sold * Price).
- Weather: Weather condition for the location (could be temperature, but for simplicity, we will categorize it as "Hot", "Cold", "Rainy").
- Promotion: A flag indicating if there was a promotion during that time (e.g., "Yes" or "No").
- Holiday: A flag to indicate if the day was a holiday (e.g., "Yes" or "No").

- **Dataset Characteristics**
{% highlight yaml %}
Total Rows: 10,000 orders
Time Range: Two years (2022–2023)
Regions: USA, Canada, Mexico
Products: 6 coffee-derived products
Customers: 1,000 unique customers
Weather Conditions: 4 types (Sunny, Rainy, Snowy, Cloudy)
{% endhighlight %}

### Implemeting the Pipeline for the Solution
To design and implement an end-to-end ML pipeline for GloboJava on Microsoft Azure, we will use Azure Machine Learning (Azure ML), Terraform, and the Azure ML Python SDK v2. The solution will include data ingestion from Snowflake, model training on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), and a scalable, reliable, and production-grade architecture. Below is the step-by-step plan

- ### Architecture Overview
The pipeline will consist of the following components:
- Data Ingestion: Ingest data from Snowflake into Azure ML's blob datastore.
- Data Preparation: Clean, preprocess, and transform the data.
- Model Training: Train machine learning models using AKS as the compute target.
- Model Deployment: Deploy the trained model to AKS for inference.
- Monitoring and Retraining: Set up monitoring and retraining pipelines for continuous improvement.

- ### Tools and Technologies
- Azure ML for managing the ML lifecycle, including datasets, experiments, and deployments.
- Terraform for infrastructure-as-code (IaC) to provision Azure resources.
- Azure ML Python SDK v2 for defining and managing the ML pipeline.
- Snowflake as the source of historical sales data.
- Azure Blob Storage for storing ingested data and model artifacts.
- AKS Compute target for scalable model training and inference.

Event-Driven Architecture: Using Azure Event Grid to trigger data ingestion and pipeline execution.
