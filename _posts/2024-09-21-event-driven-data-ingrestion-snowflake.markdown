Data loading and processing is a crucial activity for a data analytics system. Snowflake provides a variety of methods for loading data, including bulk data loading and processing data in a continuous manner. In this article, I walk you through the concept of event-driven data ingestion specifically into Snowflake, describing the external stage type. We cover data loading continuously through events Snowpipe. We also discuss basic data transformations and exporting of data from Snowflake.

EcoTrack is a fictious environmental monitoring company that collects real-time data from various sensors placed in natural reserves. These sensors track metrics such as air quality, temperature, humidity, and wildlife activity. The company aims to provide actionable insights to conservationists and policymakers to help protect endangered ecosystems.

To enhance their data processing capabilities, EcoTrack wants to implement an event-driven architecture to ingest data into their Snowflake account. They plan to use Microsoft Azure Blob Storage as an external stage to store incoming sensor data.
